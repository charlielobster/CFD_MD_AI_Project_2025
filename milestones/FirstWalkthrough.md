In this milestone, let's implement the <a href=https://docs.nvidia.com/physicsnemo/latest/user-guide/simple_training_example.html>Training Recipe</a> tutorial. 

It is based on this <a href=../papers/2010.08895v3.pdf>paper</a> about Fourier Neural Operators (FNO)s.

This paper deserves a drill-down! In addition to Darcy 2D, the paper also benchmarks against Burger and Navier-Stokes.
