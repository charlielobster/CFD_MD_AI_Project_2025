In this milestone, let's implement the <a href=https://docs.nvidia.com/physicsnemo/latest/user-guide/simple_training_example.html>Training Recipe</a> tutorial, based on the following paper:<br/>
<a href=../papers/2010.08895v3.pdf>The Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</a><br/>

The paper is so interesting, it deserved its own Drill-Down <a href=../drilldowns/FNOs.md>here</a>.
